A Flutter Web application for early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using retinal image classification powered by a deep learning model.
# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection – Flutter Web App

This repository hosts a Flutter Web application designed to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal images using a deep learning model.

## 🔍 Overview
- Upload a retina image via the web interface
- Image is processed by a FastAPI backend serving a trained PyTorch model
- Model returns a diagnosis: **DR** or **Normal**
- Display includes prediction result and confidence percentage

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Flutter Web for the frontend
- FastAPI for the backend API
- PyTorch for the CNN model (ResNet50)
- Hugging Face Spaces for backend deployment
- GitHub Pages for frontend hosting

## 📸 Features
- Retina image upload
- Real-time prediction with confidence score
- Prediction history tracking (in local session)
- Clean and responsive UI
